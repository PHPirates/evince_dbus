The file [`evince_dbus.py`](evince_dbus.py) is a fork from the file at https://github.com/GNOME/gedit-plugins/blob/master/plugins/synctex/synctex/evince_dbus.py.

It aims to be an example of how to communicate with Evince using dbus in order to forward/backward search between `.tex` and `.pdf` files.
