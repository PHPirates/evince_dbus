The file `evince_dbus.py <evince_dbus.py>`_ is a fork from the gedit synctex plugin file at https://github.com/GNOME/gedit-plugins/blob/master/plugins/synctex/synctex/evince_dbus.py.

It aims to be an example of how to communicate with Evince using dbus in order to forward/backward search between ``.tex`` and ``.pdf`` files.
